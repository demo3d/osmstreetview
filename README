This project should be executable as-is, from any web server, without any 
additional setup.

Depending on your web browser, it may even be possible to run it completely 
from a local directory without using a web server at all. Just open the 
index.html file in your web browser. This works (at least) in Firefox. Chrome/
Chromium on the other hand block file access from local files, and thus 
prevents loading of the shader code. To compensate, either start a minimal web
server to serve the files, or start Chrome/Chromium with the 
"--allow-file-access-from-files" parameter.
